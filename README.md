# Fix OneDrive doesn't work on Catalina 10.15.7

## Issue

Recently, My OneDrive was automatically and randomly upgraded to a new version: **23.246.1127**, but my system only support **23.054.0313** . So I wrote this script for speed up the process of reinstall the older version OneDrive to my computer.

## How to Use?

1. replace **PATH_TO_PKG** to your local path
2. after run script, try to open your OneDrive see if it works correctly
3. if one drive upgrade to the newer veresion again, run this script again until success :)

## Improvement

- corn jobs or launchd
